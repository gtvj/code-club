# Code school

The purpose of this repository is to contain coding challenges that will allow apprentice software developers to practice their coding skills and discuss the approach they have taken. To do this we'll need to be able to see the code that was written to solve the problems. 

There are no restrictions on the language you use or how you achieve this - we'll just need to be able to see it working (somehow) from the meeting room computer

## Exercises
