# Code club

We have spoken recently about changing the format of Code Club to:

1. Provide more structure
2. Facilitate more active contribution from all participants

The new format is simply for **each participant to research a specified topic and use the Code Club session to describe the topic to other participants**. 

## This week

We'll begin with the essential features of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) with each participant researching a topic in order to explain and demo it to the group. [This week](weeks/week_one.md) we'll start looking at ES6 essentials.  

## High-level plan for coming months

### Modern client-side JavaScript

We'll begin by exploring the newer features of ECMAScript specification (upon which JavaScript implementations are based) and associated tooling.

* [Week 1](weeks/week_one.md): ES6 essentials - Using ES6 today and object literal changes

### Testing 

We'll explore modern approaches to testing including TDD, BDD, regression and automation tests.

### Node.js and server-side JavaScript

Node.js has made JavaScript a general purpose programming language. We'll use these session to get to grips with Node.js.
