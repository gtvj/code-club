# Code club

## Purpose and format

Code club is a weekly, structured meet-up during which attendees explore development related topics. We've tried a few different formats and are currently working with two: 

* **For bigger topics** we're individually researching **the same topic** and coming together to discuss what we've found as a group (for example, Unit Testing)
* **For smaller topics** - we're individually researching **different topics** and presenting findings to other attendees (for example, ES6 arrow functions)

We keep all the material from previous weeks in the `/weeks/` directory, including the presentation slides and other materials prepared. 

## This week

The next Code Club session is on 19 April, where we'll be looking at [work-based project technologies](weeks/week_nine/plan.md)

## High-level plan for coming months

### Modern client-side JavaScript (Part 1 - ES6 Essentials)

We'll begin by exploring the newer features of ECMAScript specification (upon which JavaScript implementations are based) and associated tooling.

* [Week 1](weeks/week_one/plan.md): ES6 essentials - Using ES6 today and object literal changes
* [Week 2](weeks/week_two/plan.md): ES6 essentials - Arrow functions
* [Week 3](weeks/week_three/plan.md): ES6 essentials - Destructuring, Rest parameters and Spread operators, Template literals, Let and Const

### Testing 

We'll explore modern approaches to testing including TDD, BDD, regression and automation tests.

* [Week 4](weeks/week_four/plan.md): Discussion about unit testing and introduction to ES6 Template Literals
* [Week 5](weeks/week_five/plan.md): Continue looking at TDD

### Assistance for the Java assignment

* [Week 6](weeks/week_six/plan.md): Guidance session for the current Java assignment
* [Week 7]: No session this week - apprentices are focusing on their Java assignment (let us know if we can help with anything)

### Coding for accessibility

* [Week 8](weeks/week_eight/plan.md): We'll be covering the tools, techniques and resources available to software developers to ensure accessibility. 

### Work-based project technologies

* [Week 9](weeks/week_nine/plan.md): We'll be looking at a couple of the technologies being used in work-based projects, namely: HTML5 audio/video and Node.js

### What a Lead Developer Does

* [Week 10](weeks/week_ten/plan.md): Gwyn will provide a presentation on [What a Lead Developer does](weeks/week_ten/what_a_lead_developer_does.pdf)
