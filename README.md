# Code club

## Purpose and format

Code club is a weekly, structured meet-up during which attendees explore development related topics. We've tried a few different formats and are currently working with two: 

* **For bigger topics** we're individually researching **the same topic** and coming together to discuss what we've found as a group (for example, Unit Testing)
* **For smaller topics** - we're individually researching **different topics** and presenting findings to other attendees (for example, ES6 arrow functions)

We keep all the material from previous weeks in the `/weeks/` directory, including the presentation slides and other materials prepared. 

## This week

We'll continue (for the second week) looking at [unit testing](weeks/week_five/plan.md)

## High-level plan for coming months

### Modern client-side JavaScript (Part 1 - ES6 Essentials)

We'll begin by exploring the newer features of ECMAScript specification (upon which JavaScript implementations are based) and associated tooling.

* [Week 1](weeks/week_one/plan.md): ES6 essentials - Using ES6 today and object literal changes
* [Week 2](weeks/week_two/plan.md): ES6 essentials - Arrow functions
* [Week 3](weeks/week_three/plan.md): ES6 essentials - Destructuring, Rest parameters and Spread operators, Template literals, Let and Const

### Testing 

We'll explore modern approaches to testing including TDD, BDD, regression and automation tests.

* [Week 4](weeks/week_four/plan.md): Discussion about unit testing and introduction to ES6 Template Literals
* [Week 5](weeks/week_five/plan.md): Continue looking at TDD

### Modern client-side JavaScript (Part 2 - Classes, Symbols, Objects and Decorators)

We'll continue by looking at some slightly more advanced ES6 concepts

### Node.js and server-side JavaScript

Node.js has made JavaScript a general purpose programming language. We'll use these session to get to grips with Node.js.
