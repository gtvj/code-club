# Code club

We have spoken recently about changing the format of Code Club to:

1. Provide more structure
2. Facilitate more active contribution from all participants

The new format is simply for **each participant to research a specified topic and use the Code Club session to describe the topic to other participants**. 

## This week

We'll be looking at Template Literals and reviewing what we've learned about [unit testing](weeks/week_four/plan.md). 

## High-level plan for coming months

### Modern client-side JavaScript (Part 1 - ES6 Essentials)

We'll begin by exploring the newer features of ECMAScript specification (upon which JavaScript implementations are based) and associated tooling.

* [Week 1](weeks/week_one/plan.md): ES6 essentials - Using ES6 today and object literal changes
* [Week 2](weeks/week_two/plan.md): ES6 essentials - Arrow functions
* [Week 3](weeks/week_three/plan.md): ES6 essentials - Destructuring, Rest parameters and Spread operators, Template literals, Let and Const

### Testing 

We'll explore modern approaches to testing including TDD, BDD, regression and automation tests.

### Modern client-side JavaScript (Part 2 - Classes, Symbols, Objects and Decorators)

We'll continue by looking at some slightly more advanced ES6 concepts

### Node.js and server-side JavaScript

Node.js has made JavaScript a general purpose programming language. We'll use these session to get to grips with Node.js.
