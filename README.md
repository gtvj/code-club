# Code club

We have spoken recently about changing the format of Code Club to:

1. Provide more structure
2. Facilitate more active contribution from all participants

The new format is simply for **each participant to research a specified topic and use the Code Club session to describe the topic to other participants**. 

## This week

We'll conclude our look at the essential features of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) with each participant [researching a topic in order to explain and demo it](weeks/week_three/plan.md) to the group. 

This is our last week looking at ES6 essentials (for the time being, there is a great deal still to cover and we'll pick it up again). Next week we'll begin looking at testing.

## High-level plan for coming months

### Modern client-side JavaScript (Part 1 - ES6 Essentials)

We'll begin by exploring the newer features of ECMAScript specification (upon which JavaScript implementations are based) and associated tooling.

* [Week 1](weeks/week_one/plan.md): ES6 essentials - Using ES6 today and object literal changes
* [Week 2](weeks/week_two/plan.md): ES6 essentials - Arrow functions
* [Week 3](weeks/week_three/plan.md): ES6 essentials - Destructuring, Rest parameters and Spread operators, Template literals, Let and Const

### Testing 

We'll explore modern approaches to testing including TDD, BDD, regression and automation tests.

### Modern client-side JavaScript (Part 2 - Classes, Symbols, Objects and Decorators)

We'll continue by looking at some slightly more advanced ES6 concepts

### Node.js and server-side JavaScript

Node.js has made JavaScript a general purpose programming language. We'll use these session to get to grips with Node.js.
