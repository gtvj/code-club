# Notes from Week 4

* We discussed unit testing as part of a broader effort to ensure testing, including:
    - Going through some example QUnit Tests from the [contact forms](https://github.com/nationalarchives/tna-forms/blob/develop/js/tests/form-british-citizenship/form-british-citizenship.js) project 
    - How unit tests differ from browser (aka automated, aka end-to-end) tests, using the example of [Laravel Dusk](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/dusk)
* Manasseh provided a presentation covering ES6 Template literals and their usage

## Feedback

It's pretty clear that we're going to need more time on Unit Testing before moving on to other topics. We'll therefore continue this in the next session.
