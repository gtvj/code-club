# Unit Testing: self-directed learning

This week: 

* Manasseh will be taking us through ES6 Template Literals
* We'll discuss what we've researched on unit testing

## Preparing for the session

This week is going to be a little different because I'd like you to take a self-directed approach to achieving the goal of:

* Understanding unit testing to a level that you can begin writing unit tests as a routine part of your development (you'll learn most about unit testing through practice)
* Being able to set up and work with [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com) and [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/index.html)

There are many resources on the web related to unit testing as well as a lot of good books covering the topic (books can be ordered through the library). Here are some resources to get you started:

* [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com) is the JavaScript unit testing framework used (and developed) by the jQuery team. It's also arguably the easiest place to start with JavaScript unit testing.
    * Read and understand the [Introduction to Unit Testing](http://qunitjs.com/intro/) - _Everyone_
    * Get a sense of what you can do with QUnit by browsing the 'Main methods' and 'Assertions' provided by the [QUnit API](http://api.qunitjs.com) - _Everyone_
    * Follow the documentation to set up and play with QUnit - _Everyone_
* [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/index.html) is the unit testing framework you'll be using for PHP. The PHPUnit website has [several video presentations that introduce unit testing in PHP](https://phpunit.de/presentations.html). Watch a couple/few of these to get familiar with PHPUnit.
* One of the benefits of adopting a test-driven approach is that it requires us to design an approach to a problem up-front and in a structured, intentional way. This can be a difficult but it is well worth it. The approach to producing code in this way has been described by Rebecca Murphy in:
    * [an article on A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/writing-testable-javascript) 
    * [a conference talk from 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzjogCFO4Zo&t=24s)
    
## Goal for the session

By the end of the session I'd like everyone to be ready to use unit testing as a standard part of their development or to understand areas that you feel you need to explore further.
