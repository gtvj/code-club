# ES6 Essentials: Part 2 

We'll continue with ES6 essentials this week by looking at arrow functions

## Arrow functions

ES6 introduced arrow functions as a new way of writing anonymous functions in JavaScript. This change is more than syntactic sugar - arrow functions are fundamentally different in several important ways. 

* Describe the different **flavours of arrow function syntax** and how they differ - providing examples of each. If you'd like to, solve a kata or two from [codewars.com](http://www.codewars.com/) using one or more arrow function flavours as a demonstration _Annabel and Ed_
* Describe **three ways in which arrow functions behave differently** to traditional JavaScript functions - providing examples of each _Ash and Manasseh_

### Preparing for the session

Please prepare something for the session that can be added to this repository so that the group can refer to it as a learning resource. This could be some PowerPoint slides, JavaScript files or any electronic format that works for you.
