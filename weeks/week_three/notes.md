# Notes from week one

* In response to a question Ash had asked in a pull request, Gwyn took the group through the purpose and benefits of using atomic commits. Gwyn's slide are attached. 
* Ash provided an overview of object and array destructuring
* Ed provided an overview of Rest parameters and the Spread operator. This is a tricky topic - not least because Rest and Spread are quite similar.
* James provided an overview of let and const, and how they differ from var. We discussed the various benefits of each.

## Feedback and plan for next time

Everyone said they were happy with the format of Code Club and felt that it is adding value. Gwyn has suggested that we follow up the discussion about atomic commits with a hands-on session on unit testing next time.
