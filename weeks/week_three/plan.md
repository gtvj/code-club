# ES6 Essentials: the last session

This is our last session on ES6 Essentials, so there's quite a bit to be covered.

* **Destructuring** is a new expressive feature of ES6. _Ash_ - please prepare a description and examples of both **object** and **array** destructuring to the group
* **Rest parameters** significantly simplify working with functions that accept an arbitrary number of arguments (aka variadic functions). ES6 also provides the **Spread operator** which performs a similar but distinct function. _Ed_ please prepare a description and examples of Rest parameters and the Spread operator to the group
* **Template literals** provide a native mechanism for string interpolation in ES6. _Manasseh_ please prepare a description and examples of ES6 Template literals including their multi-line capabilities (there is no need to cover Tagged Template Literals here, unless you'd particularly like to)
* ES6 introduces **let** and **const** as alternatives to `var`. _James_ please prepare a description and examples of these focusing on how they differ from `var` in terms of scoping rules and when you might choose each. 

### Preparing for the session

Please prepare something for the session that can be added to this repository so that the group can refer to it as a learning resource. This could be some PowerPoint slides, JavaScript files or any electronic format that works for you.
