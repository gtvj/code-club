# Unit Testing: self-directed learning (Part 2)

This week is a continuation of our work to look at unit testing. Please make sure you've covered the material from [Week 4](/weeks/week_four/plan.md) before the session.
    
## Goal for the session

By the end of the session I'd like everyone to be ready to use unit testing as a standard part of their development or to understand areas that you feel you need to explore further.
