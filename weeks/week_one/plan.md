# ES6 Essentials: Part 1

We'll start week one with some simple syntactic sugar that's been added to JavaScript in ES6 and approaches to tooling: 

## Using ES6 today

JavaScript developers are expected to know and make use of modern language features provided by ES6, even though almost all will need to support older browsers. For this reason 'transpilers' like [Babel](http://babeljs.io) have become an essential tool. 

* Research what Babel does, explain it to the group and provide a demo - _Annabel_ and _James_

## Object literal changes

* Explain **method definition syntax** and give an example - _Manasseh_
* Explain **property value shorthands** and give an example - _Ed_
* Explain **computed property names** and give an example - _Ash_
