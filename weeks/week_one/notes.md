# Notes from week one

Session went OK and it was pretty clear there had been quite a lot of collaboration in preparation. The group was extended to include MD and PC who had stated an interest in attending. It could have been improved if: 

* We had access to development machines in the session. We are a little limited without machines. 
* There had been a more consistent means of presenting what had been learned (GJ has asked everyone to prepare something that can be added to the repository for next week)
* The learning had been structured around a particular challenge (suggested by AB). In preparing for Week 2, GJ found this too time consuming since it is difficult to identify kata that will be suited to an individual's skill level and can be applied to the given topic. GJ has therefore suggested that apprentices identify a suitable kata and use this for demonstration purposes, if they would like to.
